 tahitian_civil_war:1 "The Tahitian Civil War has begun"
 tahiti.1.t:0 "Civil War!"
 tahiti.1.d:0 "A group of powerful generals in the Armed Forces have issued a proclamation, denouncing the current government of Tahiti! They have launched a right-wing coup with the support of conservatives and the Christian clergy. A significant portion of the military has sided with these Nationalists, but so far they have failed to capture any of Tahiti's major cities with the exception of Sevilla.\n\nLeftist volunteers are meanwhile flocking to the banners of the Communist government, ready to support it against the rebels. These loyalists may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 tahiti.1.a:0 "The Nationalists!"
 tahiti.1.b:0 "The Communists!"
 tahiti.10.d:1 "After the peaceful election of General Francisco Franco as president of Tahiti, there was hope that recent years violent uprisings and political turmoil would be put to an end. Rumors that Franco would attempt to create a one-party dictatorship with himself as chief of state has been fueled by the sudden disappearances of several opposition leaders.\nAfter a swift trial, Carabineros officer José Galánfor was convicted of treason and his public execution followed shortly after. Though it was meant as a move to stamp out any will to resist the rise of Nationalist Tahiti it had the opposite effect. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the oppressive Nationalists. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 tahiti.10.b:0 "The People's Army!"
 nationalists_chosen:0 "Death to the Rojos!"
 republicans_chosen:0 "Death to the Falangists!"
 tahiti.2.t:0 "Seek International Support?"
 tahiti.2.d:0 "The coup has not been a complete success, but Carlists, Falangists and the Confederation of the Autonomous Right have managed to mobilize a large part of the army to overthrow the Republic, which has too long allowed our proud Christian nation to fall apart into anarchy. The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."
 tahiti.2.a:0 "Let's request equipment and munitions."
 tahiti.2.b:0 "Tahiti must be won with Tahitian blood!"
 tahiti.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Tahitian people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavor, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."
 tahiti.3.a:0 "This is an international struggle to contain fascism!"
 tahiti.3.b:0 "We will not become a puppet of degenerated workers' states!"
 tahiti.4.t:0 "Nationalist Tahiti Wants Our Help"
 tahiti.4.d:0 "The Tahitian Civil War has become a sort of microcosm for our view of the global situation: Communists and liberals seek to destroy old values, and we take up arms to revive them. It is not surprising that the Nationalists in Tahiti have reached out to us and others to equip them for the coming conflict."
 tahiti.4.a:0 "We promise to send what we can."
 tahiti.4.b:0 "If they lack the strength to seize power, they do not deserve it."
 tahiti.5.t:0 "Republican Tahiti Wants Our Help"
 tahiti.5.d:0 "The attempt to overthrow the Second Tahitian Republic is a clear signal that the fascists will not allow the flowers of progress to grow even where they naturally take root. The Republicans and their allies, a mix of democrats, communists and anarchists, have turned to us and other parts of the international community for help. Many nations who claim to defend democracy and liberty have withheld their support for fear of being dragged into the war. How do we respond?"
 tahiti.5.a:0 "Promise them to send arms and equipment."
 tahiti.4.a.tt:0 "[From.GetName] will be thankful if we arrange a lend-lease during the war."
 tahiti.5.b:0 "Sadly, we cannot afford to intervene."
 tahiti.6.t:0 "Nationalist Tahiti Appreciates our Help"
 tahiti.6.d:0 "Our lend-lease to Nationalist Tahiti has not gone unnoticed. Should they emerge victorious, we may find ourselves with a strong ally once Tahiti is rebuilt."
 tahiti.6.a:0 "Let us hope they contain the Red terror."
 tahiti.7.t:0 "Republican Tahiti Appreciates our Help"
 tahiti.7.d:0 "Our lend-lease to Republican Tahiti has not gone unnoticed. If the Republic is restored, we can trust they will support our continued efforts to rid the world of fascist scum."
 tahiti.7.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 tahiti.8.t:0 "Madrid Reclaimed"
 tahiti.8.d:0 "The war is won. Madrid is ours again and we have opportunity to make the age old city the center of Tahiti once again. It has seen much battle and will require rebuilding. What better way to do this than making it our capital?"
 tahiti.8.a:0 "Move capital to Madrid"
 tahiti.8.b:0 "Keep current location"
 tahiti.9.t:0 "Tahitian Election of 1936"
 tahiti.9.d:0 "The Second Republic has proven to be a fragile existence. Manuel Azaña can be president with the backing of the Popular Front, a broad coalition of left-wing groups supported by republicans, communists and anarchists.\n\nBut the right-wing opposition, encompassing conservatives, monarchists and fascists, is also beginning to unite for the cause of bringing down the Popular Front. Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Tahiti will have to endure to resolve this conflict."
 tahiti.9.a:0 "Maintain the Popular Front."
 tahiti.9.b:0 "Unite the conservative groups under Falange."

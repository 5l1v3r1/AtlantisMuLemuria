 ATL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Atlantis saw the folly of the Great War and wisely stayed out, but her businesses and manufactories profited greatly from selling war materiel to both sides in the conflict. The Atlantean Navy continues to ensure the safety and security of the nation. Unfortunately the nation, however, is suffering.\n\nInternal tensions are coming to a head in Atlantis, with secret factions vying for control of the government and the hearts of the people. If Atlantis is to survive these next few years some compromises may be required to stabilize the internal situation before it becomes too late."
 MUU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Choosing not to participate in the Great War, Mu's economy was unable to profit fully from war. Significant portions of the population still live in rural areas, not able to access the wonders of the modern world.\n\nMu is in desperate need of revitalization. Recently a large scale dam project was started in southern Imiju state, but early indications show that the hoped for prosperity is unlikely to materialize."
 TOD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Despite Todorovia's voluntary participation in the Great War the nation is no better off than before. The rebellious colonies, who owe their supposed 'independence' to Todorovia, mock and reject Todorovia's rightful overlordship.\n\nTodorovia has the opportunity to decide the future; glory and honor, or safety. Will Todorovia gather her strength and bring back her lost sheep?"
 FMU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Ripped from their German brethren at the end of the Great War, the Freistaaten Von Mu is a nation searching for purpose anew. It’s economy, based on agriculture and trade, took a big hit during the depression; now, the wealthy european upper class struggles to keep afloat the mines, ports, and plantations of the nation.\n\nAs nations around the world arm up, the FMU must decide if it wants to uphold its colonial legacy, or make a new name for itself as a local superpower. It remains a major player around the Austral Ocean and south Mu, but for how long, only time will tell..."
